  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

// EXAMPLE SOLUTION CODE:
function Airplane(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isFlying = false;
}
Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  this.isFlying = true;
};
Airplane.prototype.land = function () {

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"
*/

  if (this.stomach.length < 10){ // fucking confusing, but here your making sure theres room in the stomach because you obviously have to have a cap and 10 food items sounds like a good one?
    this.stomach.push(someFood) // here you are pushing the edible(someFood) into the stomach.

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window Binding - these are all of the built in objects, this will bind to the global object 
  2. Implicit Binding - using "this." , which referes to the object on which the function is called
  3. Explicit Binding - if you use call, bind, or apply if you want "this." to point to a certain value
  4. New Binding - this is when you use the new keyword to make a new object, 'this.' will not point to the new object
